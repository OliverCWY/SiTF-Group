            <li>Real numbers are a list of different types of numbers that can be classified into groups</li>
            <li>An approximation is anything that is similar, but not exactly equal, to something else. A number can be approximated by rounding. A calculation can be approximated by rounding the values within it.</li>

                <li><b>Natural Numbers</b> consist of positive integers. Natural numbers are usually known as counting numbers. E.g. `1,2,3,4,5,6.......` </li>
                <li><b>Whole Numbers</b> is a member of the set of positive integers and 0. E.g. `0,1,2,3,4,5,6......`</li>
                <li><b>Prime Numbers</b> are natural numbers greater than 1 and have only 2 factors: 1 and itself. Natural numbers that are greater than 1 which are not prime are called composite numbers. E.g. `2,3,5,7,11,13`</li>
                <li><b>Integers</b> consist of natural numbers, their negative and the number 0. E.g. `-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4.....`</li>
                <li><b>Fractions</b> are an expression of the form a/b where a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0. E.g. `1/3 , 2/5`</li>
                <li><b>Rational numbers</b> are numbers that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, a and b, in the form a/b where b is not equal to 0. E.g. `1/8, 1/3 and 4`</li>
                <li><b>Irrational numbers</b> are numbers that cannot be expressed in the form of a/b for any integers a and b. Irrational numbers have decimal expansions that never terminate and never repeat. E.g. `pi` </li>

                <li>There are five rules that you need to remeber and these are very important.</li>
                <li>All non-zero digits are significant</li>
                <li>A zero or zeros between non-zero digits are significant</li>
                <li>In a decimal, all zeros after a non-zero digit are significant</li>
                <li>In a decimal, all zeros before a non-zero digit are not significant</li>
                <li>In whole number, the zeros at the end may or may not be significant. It depends on how the numbers are approximated</li>
