            <h6 class="hide" id="simple" class="hide" style="padding: 5px;">
                <li>Simple interest is a type of interest that is applied to the amount borrowed or invested for the entire duration of the loan, without taking any other factors into account, such as past interest (paid or charged) or any other financial considerations. The formula for simple interest is:</li>
                <center><abbr style="font-size:20px">`I=PRT`</abbr><br> where `P=`principal, `R=`interest rate and `T=`time in years.</center>
                <li>For example, if you deposited $1000 in a savings account, how much more money will you receive after 5 years if the bank pays 2% simple interest annually?<br>
                You would receive 10% of $1000 as simple interest.</li>
                <li>Compound interest is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, interest on interest. The formula for compound interest is: </li>
                <center><abbr style="font-size:20px">`I=P(1+r/n)^(nt)`</abbr><br> where `P=`principal amount, `r=`annual interest rate, `n=`number of times the interest is compounded each year and `t=`number of years.</center>
