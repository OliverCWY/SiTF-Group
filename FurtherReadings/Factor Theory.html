		<div>
		    Factor Theorm is a theory to factorize polynomials and solve integral eqations that students learn in Year 3.<br>
		    <br>
		    For any polynomial `P(x)=ax^n+bx^(n-1)+...+z`, if `P(k)=0`, where `k in {r/s:r,s in ZZ, r|z, s|a}`, `(x-k)` is a factor of `P(x)` and vise versa.
		    <br>
		    The question now is: can it give us all the real roots of any integral equation?<br>
		    <br>
		    Surprisingly, yes, but why?<br>
		    <br>

				Firstly, make the coefficient of the hightest power of `x` be `1`, and then consider the product of the root and another rational number. Remember to use the property of rational numbers mentioned in Factors and Multiples!<br>
    		</div>
			<a class="resHeading block causeSlideOnClick" href="#proof" target="proof">[Proof]</a>
			<div id="proof" class="hide">
			    For a eqation `ax^n+bx^(n-1)+...+z=0`, we divide it by `a`.<br>
			    Then we get `x^n+b/ax^(n-1)+...+z/a=0`.<br>
			    Considering a rational root of this eqation, `-r/s` where `r,s in ZZ and (r,s)=1`, we can transform the eqation into `(x+r/s)(x^(n-1)+Bx^(n-2)+...+Z)=0`.<br>
			    `Z` can be expressed as `p/q` where `p,q in ZZ and (p,q)=1`, as it is a rational number.<br>
			    By inspection, `r/s*Z=z/a`, meaning that `(r*p)/(s*q)=z/a`.<br>
			    Since `r, p, s, q, z, a` are all integers and `(r,s)=(p,q)=1`, `r*p` is a factor of `z` and `s*q` is a factor of `a`.<br>
			    Hence, `r|z and s|a`. (Proven)<br>
			    Did you get it? :P<br>
